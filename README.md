# Automated Classes Presence
___ 
## About
This is a quite simple script to make what I am lazy to do. Check my presence during my university online classes.

:warning: **`IT ONLY WORKS FOR MICROSOFT EDGE BROWSER`** :warning:
___
## Configure and Run it
To make it works you only need to:
1) Open the [source code](source.py) and define your `email` and `password`
2) Open this [executable](CheckPresence.bat) and change both directories (python compiler and script)
3) And voil√°, you have your presence checked :smile:
